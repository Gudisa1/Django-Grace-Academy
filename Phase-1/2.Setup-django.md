# 🎥 **Lesson 2: Install Python & VS Code for Django Development**

This lesson explains **what you need to install**, **why you need it**, and **how it fits into Django development**.

---

# 1️⃣ Install Python

Django is built using **Python**, so installing Python is the first step.

## ✔ What is Python in this context?

* Python is the **programming language** Django uses.
* Django is a **Python package**, meaning Python must be installed before you can install Django.

### ✔ What version do you need?

* Use **Python 3.10 or newer**.
* Django does **not** support Python 2.

## ✔ How to Install Python (Step-by-Step)

### **Windows**

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Download **Python 3.x**.
3. IMPORTANT: Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**.
4. Click **Install Now**.

### **Mac**

1. Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
2. Download and run the installer.
3. Follow the setup wizard.

### **Linux**

Python often comes preinstalled.
Check with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not installed:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

---

## ✔ Verify Installation

Run in terminal/command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you see something like:

```
Python 3.11.2
```

You’re good!

# 2️⃣ Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is a **lightweight, powerful code editor** used by many Django developers.

## ✔ Why use VS Code?

* Clean user interface
* Amazing support for Python
* Built-in terminal
* Extensions for formatting, linting, and debugging
* Works perfectly with Django projects

---

## ✔ How to Install VS Code (Step-by-Step)

### **All operating systems**

1. Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download VS Code for your OS.
3. Install it using the setup wizard.

Open VS Code → ready!

# 3️⃣ Install Python Extensions in VS Code

Extensions add extra features.
For Django development, you need **at least two** essential extensions.

---

## ✔ 1. Microsoft Python Extension

This extension gives you:

* Python syntax highlighting
* Autocomplete
* Code linting
* Virtual environment detection
* Debugging support

### How to install:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (left sidebar icon or `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search **Python**
4. Install the one by **Microsoft** (blue icon)

## ✔ 2. Pylance (Optional but recommended)

Pylance provides **fast, intelligent code analysis**.

Benefits:

* Smarter autocomplete
* Better error detection
* Faster performance

Install it the same way:

* Search **Pylance**
* Install

# ⭐ Optional but Useful Extensions

You may add these later:

### ✔ Django Extension Pack

Includes features like:

* Django template support
* Snippets
* Model navigation

### ✔ Prettier or Black Formatter

For clean, consistent code formatting.
