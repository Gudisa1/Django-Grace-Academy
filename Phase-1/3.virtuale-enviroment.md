## **Lesson: Virtual Environment & Django Installation**

### **1. What is a Virtual Environment (venv)?**

A **virtual environment** is a self-contained folder where Python can install packages **separately from your system Python**.

* **Why it matters:**

  * Avoids conflicts between projects. For example, Project A might need Django 4.2, while Project B needs Django 4.1.
  * Keeps your system clean by not installing packages globally.
  * Makes your project easier to share with others.

* **Analogy:** Think of it like a personal toolbox for a specific project — it has all the tools you need without borrowing from someone else’s toolbox.

### **2. Creating a Virtual Environment**

Command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

* **Breakdown:**

  * `python -m venv` → tells Python to create a virtual environment.
  * `venv` → the name of the folder where your environment lives. You can name it anything, but “venv” is conventional.

* **What happens:** A new folder `venv/` is created with its own Python interpreter and `site-packages` (where libraries are installed).

---

### **3. Activating the Virtual Environment**

* **Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Mac/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* **Why activation is needed:** It tells your terminal to use the Python and packages inside the virtual environment, not the global Python.

* **Tip:** You’ll know it’s activated because the terminal prompt usually changes to show `(venv)` at the start.

---

### **4. Installing Django**

Once the virtual environment is active:

```bash
pip install django
```

* **Explanation:**

  * `pip` → Python’s package manager, used to install libraries.
  * `django` → the web framework we want to use.

* **Why it matters:** Installing inside the venv ensures only this project uses that Django version.

* **Real-world example:** You can have one website using Django 4.2 and another using Django 3.3 on the same computer, without conflicts.

---

### **5. Freezing Requirements**

Command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

* **Purpose:**

  * `pip freeze` lists all installed packages and their exact versions.
  * Redirecting it with `>` saves this list to a file `requirements.txt`.

* **Why it matters:**

  * Makes your project **reproducible**. Anyone else can run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    and get the exact same setup.

* **Analogy:** Think of it as writing down a recipe so anyone can cook the same dish exactly the way you did.

### **Summary Table**

| Step                 | Command                         | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Create virtual env   | `python -m venv venv`           | Isolate project dependencies                      |
| Activate virtual env | `source venv/bin/activate`      | Use the venv’s Python and packages                |
| Install Django       | `pip install django`            | Add Django framework to the project               |
| Freeze requirements  | `pip freeze > requirements.txt` | Save project’s exact packages for reproducibility |

### **Next Step / Check Your Understanding**

Try this:

1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Activate it.
3. Install Django.
4. Freeze the requirements and check the contents of `requirements.txt`.

**Question to think about:**
Why is it risky to install Django globally instead of in a virtual environment?
